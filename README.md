## ⚙ How It Works

The system uses three dictionaries:

- `patients` → Stores patient details
- `doctors` → Stores doctor details
- `appointments` → Stores appointment details

### Main Functionalities:

1. **Add Patient**
   - Patient ID
   - Name
   - Age
   - Gender
   - Disease

2. **Add Doctor**
   - Doctor ID
   - Name
   - Specialization

3. **Schedule Appointment**
   - Appointment ID
   - Patient ID
   - Doctor ID
   - Date

The system validates whether the patient and doctor exist before scheduling an appointment.
